## A quick note

The project is made of three separated components that work together: an API, a web interface and a cron job. The API is the core of the project and the only vital part, the web interface is used to allow easy access to the data and to export xlsx files and the cron job is used to regularly update the data.

## Deploying the API server

### Requirements

- Any web server (Apache works fine)
- **PHP >= 7.4.2** with the following extension installed and enabled:
  - curl ([Client URL Library](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl))
  - mbstring
  - PDO and pdo_mysql ([PDO Drivers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-mysql.php))
  - yaml ([YAML Data Serialization](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.yaml.php))
- **Composer >= 1.9.3** (https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- **MySQL >= 5.7.24**

To check the installed PHP version on your server, run:

```sh
# Linux
curl --head http://adress.com

# Windows
telnet your.webserver.com 80
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
```

you should have a similar output:

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 09 Jun 2020 13:28:14 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.35 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1d PHP/7.4.2
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
```

To check the current MySQL version, you first need to login to the MySQL server and after that issue a standard SELECT statement:

```sh
mysql --host=localhost --user=myname --password mydb
```

```sql
SELECT VERSION();
```

### Database setup

In the `MySQL/` folder, you'll find the database dump ([dump-crouzet_pricing-202006091544.sql](./MySQL/dump-crouzet_pricing-202006091544.sql)). This dump is holding the table structure, the relations and the triggers necessary to ensure smooth operation of the server API.

All you need to do to set the database is to import these dumps using your favorite method. For the sake of this document we'll describe importing with MySLQ CLI. First, login to MySQL:

```bash
mysql --host=localhost --user=myname --password
# Enter password: *****
# Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
# Your MySQL connection id is 812
# Server version: 5.7.24 MySQL Community Server (GPL)
#
# Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.
#
# Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
# affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
# owners.
#
# Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
```

once you're logged-in, start by creating a new database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE new_db_name CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
/* Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) */
```

exit the MySQL client (`exit;`), then run

```sh
mysql â€“u username â€“p new_db_name < dump-crouzet_pricing-202006091544.sql
# Enter password: *****
```

if everything went fine, there should be no output. To check that the import worked, log back in and show all the tables:

```sql
USE new_db_name;
/* Database changed */
SHOW TABLES;
/*+---------------------------+
* | Tables_new_db_name        |
* +---------------------------+
* | prices_history            |
* | product_match             |
* | products                  |
* | stock_history             |
* +---------------------------+
* 4 rows in set (0.00 sec) */
```

ðŸŽ‰ MySQL is ready to rock.

### API deployment

The API is written in PHP. All you need to do is to copy the `src/api/` folder to generate the autoloader and copy the source files to the server.

#### Autoloader

First, make sure that Composer is installed (`composer -v`), if it is not, see: https://getcomposer.org/download/. Then, run:

```sh
composer dump-autoload --optimize --no-dev
```

Composer will dump the autoload in `vendor/autoload.php`. You will need this file to be on the server as well as the PHP source files. To do so, copy the autoloader to the `src` folder:

```sh
cp vendor/autoload.php src/api
```

After that, edit `src/api/index.php` to point to `autoloader.php` so that the beginning of the file looks like this:

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . 'autoload.php'; // <- this line was modified
```

#### Database settings

We will now need to fill in the details for the database connection to work.

Start by renaming `db.ini.sample` to `db.ini` and fill in the values:

```ini
host = 127.0.0.1
name = new_db_name
user = user
pass = password
type = mysql
```

Then, rename `netcomponents.ini.sample` to `netcomponents.ini` and change the values as well:

```ini
password = user:pass
```

#### Copy the files to the server

Then, copy the `src/api` folder to the server. You can check if the API deployment was successful by browsing to your server (eg. http://localhost/api). If you see the documentation in a JSON format, you're good!

```JSON
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Well, here is the documentation.",
  "body": {
    ...
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ The API is ready to rock.

### Security concerns

1. We strongly encourage you to create a specific MySQL user with only the `insert`, `select` and `update` permissions on your database and to use that user when searching the historical data.
2. You should protect at all costs the `db.ini` and `netcomponents.ini` files as they contains all the necessary access code to your server and the NetComponents API.

## cron job

The cron job is used to update on a regular basis the stock informations. A basic cron job is provided in `src/cron/updatestock.sh`. You want to run the PHP script located in `src/tasks/UpdateStock.php`.

```sh
# cron task to update the stock of all the parts each week
#
# This will launch the task each monday at 00:00
0 0 * * MON /usr/bin/php /opt/api/tasks/UpdateStock.php

```

## Web client

### Requirements

To build the web client from source, you will need:

- NodeJS LTS (latest LTS version is tested and will work, you can get it at https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn (ideally)

### Build

First, install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn install
```

Before building the project, you want to change the content of `src/web/dbconfig.json` to reflect your current database setup. Then build the project:

```sh
yarn run build
```

The output folder is `dist/`. The production bundle is optimized to the last bit and the dependencies are embedded, so you don't need to worry about the size or installing the dependencies to the server.

Once the project has been built, simply copy the `dist/` folder to your server.

ðŸŽ‰ The web interface is ready to rock.

**Congratulations, you've successfully deployed the project!**
